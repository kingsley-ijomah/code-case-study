### OO Principles
1 Encapsulate what varies
2 Favor composition over inheritance
3 Program to interfaces, not implementations
4 Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5 Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
6 Depend on abstractions, Do not depend on concretion
7 Only talk to your friends
